witty.txt contains the entire dataset which we will be using for training of our dataset.

chatbot-model.ipynb is the notebook where we will be training the complete model from scratch using multiple 1-Dimensional convolutional layers and deep learning.

chatbot-final.ipynb consists of the code to run our model by using the trained weights and the tokenizer saved.
